## This repository illustrates how terraform configuration can be used to create resources using AWS and Docker as provider.

## Managing Wordpress with Terraform

Terraform file `docker_wordpress.tf` is configured to create 2 docker containers, one running mySQL and other to run Wordpress. Both the containers are configured to run in same network. 

## Managing resources in AWS with Terraform

Terraform file `ec2.tf` is configured to create an EC2 instance and an Elastic Load Balancer

## CMDs to run the Terraform file

* `terraform init` - command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
* `terraform plan` - command is used to create an execution plan. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state
* `terraform apply` - command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan
